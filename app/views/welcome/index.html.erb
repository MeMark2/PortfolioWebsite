          Hello there, my name is Jorge Ramirez and this is my portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having numerous different interests and being currently enrolled in Conestoga College's <a href="http://www.conestogac.on.ca/fulltime/1132C.jsp" target="_blank">Software Engineering Technology</a> program, you will find a wide variety of projects that I've had the opportunity to work on. Software development, musical composition, game design and creative writing are among the many disciplines that I've had the pleasure of exploring while taking these projects on.
